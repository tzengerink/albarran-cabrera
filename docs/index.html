                        Time, reality, existence, identity and empathy are very interesting
                        subjects, but the most fascinating thing is the relation between
                        them. These relations are difficult to explain by means of words
                        and that‘s why we rely on images. We are particularly interested in
                        memories. We want to play with the memories of the viewer to construct
                        a representation inside their minds. Of course we will never know what
                        the final result will be, because any person has different memories
                        and has grown up in different cultures and environments. Our images
                        will only be the bare bones of this mental construction.

                        PRODUCTION

                        We use a wide range of processes and materials. Some of these processes
                        are the result of the combination of several old photographic processes
                        or they can be a mixture of new and old ones. Thus we use, platinum,
                        palladium, cyanotype or gelatine silver processes. But we have also
                        invented and developed new processes, as it is the case of the one we
                        use for our colour prints: pigments, Japanese paper and gold leaf.

                        All this serves just one single purpose: we want to have far more
                        parameters to play with the viewer than just the image. The texture,
                        colour, finishing, tones; even the border of a print can give extra
                        information to the viewer. And you can have a better control over this
                        information just using the correct process and materials for a specific
                        image.

                        STATEMENT

                        When we look at a photograph related to our experiences, our intangible
                        and unreliable memories surrender to the printed image. The concrete
                        photographs replace our abstract memories, and our identity is certified
                        by that set of photographs.

                        Some time ago, a friend gave us some negatives and old postcards he had
                        found inside a picture wallet in the trash. After scanning the negatives,
                        we found they were family portraits taken about 40 years ago by an amateur
                        photographer. All shared a common feature: they were underexposed, so it
                        was hard to recognize the people pictured.

                        The family could belong to anyone. Those moments, that formed part of the
                        photographer’s identity, could also be ours. So, we decided to use our
                        own photographs along with the anonymous ones, unifying all of them using
                        the same printing process and thus generating the identity and memories of
                        someone who never existed.

                        <!--
                        STATEMENT

                        There is the story of the infant Krishna, wrongly accused of eating a bit
                        of dirt. His mother, Yashoda, coming up to him with a wagging finger scolds
                        him: ‘You shouldn’t eat dirt, you naughty boy.’ ‘But I haven’t,’ says the
                        unchallenged lord of all and everything, in spot disguised as a frightened
                        human child. ‘Tut! Tut! Open your mouth,’ orders Yashoda. Krishna does as
                        he is told. He opens his mouth and Yashoda gasps.

                        She sees in Krisna’s mouth the whole complete entire timeless universe, all
                        the stars and planets of space and the distance between them, all the lands
                        and seas of the earth and the life in them; she sees all the days of
                        yesterday and all the days of tomorrow; she sees all ideas and all emotions,
                        all pity and all hope, and the three strands of matter; not a pebble, candle,
                        creature, village or galaxy is missing, including herself and every bit of
                        dirt in its truthful place.

                        ‘My Lord, you can close your mouth,’ she says reverently.

                        In any part of the universe there is a whole universe –Hamlet saw the infinite space in a nutshell; William Blake saw a world in a grain of sand, a heaven in a wild flower, and eternity in an hour.

                        <h1>Kαιρός (Kairos)</h1>
                        <!--
                        STATEMENT

                        When writing to a friend about Ulysses, James Joyce said: ”There is no
                        past, no future; everything flows in an eternal present”.

                        In this series, we use photography to represent the concept of the ‘Eternal
                        Present’. ‘The Now’ which the Greeks called Kairos –καιρός– to differentiate
                        it from ‘time’ –Chronos–.

                        The challenge lies in translating into photographic terms an abstract idea as
                        the ‘Eternal Present’. Two photos of the Great Buddha of Kamakura gave us the
                        key: we put together two portions of two consecutive photographs which represent
                        a past and future moment with respect to a present time. The ‘Eternal Present’
                        is depicted by the line between the two pictures. The perception of this line,
                        like the fact of ‘seeing the present’, can be more or less obvious, but the less
                        visible it is, the further from the truth our reality is. When human beings focus
                        only on the past or on the future, they are unable to ‘see’ the ‘Now’. Only Buddha,
                        in his eternal meditation, seems to exist forever in the ‘Now’.

                        We have created images that are not a faithful representation of reality, a metaphor
                        of the fact that past and future are not real. Past and future only exist in the
                        mind. As explained by St. Augustine: we are drawn into the past by our memories and
                        extended into the future by our expectations. This doesn’t let us experience the
                        ‘Eternal Present’ which is the only truth in our perception of time.

                        STATEMENT

                        In the beginning there was an empty darkness, a formless void of emptiness known
                        as chaos. The only thing emerging from that darkness was Nyx (night), a bird with
                        black wings. With the wind she laid a golden egg and for ages she sat upon this
                        egg. Finally life began to stir in the egg and out of it rose Eros, the god of
                        love. One half of the shell rose into the air and became the sky and the other became
                        the Earth. Eros named the sky Uranus and the Earth he named Gaia. Then Eros made them
                        fall in love.

                        This is one version of the Greek creation myth. It considers that we started from
                        “nothing” and evolved fairly rapidly towards the environment which we experience today.
                        Current cosmological models maintain that 13.8 billion years ago, the entire mass of
                        the universe was compressed into a gravitational singularity, the so-called cosmic egg,
                        from which it expanded to its current state (following the Big Bang).
