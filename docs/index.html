                        Time, reality, existence, identity and empathy are very interesting
                        subjects, but the most fascinating thing is the relation between
                        them. These relations are difficult to explain by means of words
                        and that‘s why we rely on images. We are particularly interested in
                        memories. We want to play with the memories of the viewer to construct
                        a representation inside their minds. Of course we will never know what
                        the final result will be, because any person has different memories
                        and has grown up in different cultures and environments. Our images
                        will only be the bare bones of this mental construction.

                        PRODUCTION

                        We use a wide range of processes and materials. Some of these processes
                        are the result of the combination of several old photographic processes
                        or they can be a mixture of new and old ones. Thus we use, platinum,
                        palladium, cyanotype or gelatine silver processes. But we have also
                        invented and developed new processes, as it is the case of the one we
                        use for our colour prints: pigments, Japanese paper and gold leaf.

                        All this serves just one single purpose: we want to have far more
                        parameters to play with the viewer than just the image. The texture,
                        colour, finishing, tones; even the border of a print can give extra
                        information to the viewer. And you can have a better control over this
                        information just using the correct process and materials for a specific
                        image.

                        <!--
                        When we look at a photograph related to our experiences, our intangible
                        and unreliable memories surrender to the printed image. The concrete
                        photographs replace our abstract memories, and our identity is certified
                        by that set of photographs.

                        Some time ago, a friend gave us some negatives and old postcards he had
                        found inside a picture wallet in the trash. After scanning the negatives,
                        we found they were family portraits taken about 40 years ago by an amateur
                        photographer. All shared a common feature: they were underexposed, so it
                        was hard to recognize the people pictured.

                        The family could belong to anyone. Those moments, that formed part of the
                        photographer’s identity, could also be ours. So, we decided to use our
                        own photographs along with the anonymous ones, unifying all of them using
                        the same printing process and thus generating the identity and memories of
                        someone who never existed.
